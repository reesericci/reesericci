### What I've been up to (accurate as of 2/21/22)

I learned Svelte and it's **amazing**! It has so many features and just compiles down to what you actually use; it's super fast and yet so powerful. 
It also brings JS into your HTML and not the other way around which is so much more intuitive.

I just launched v3 for the shortie.sh frontend! It's written in Svelte using Sveltekit on Netlify as the hosting. Go check it out at well, shortie.sh. It's a dead-simple url shortener that's privacy-respecting.

I also created an email newsletter for my thoughts at [news.reeseric.ci](https://news.reeseric.ci)
